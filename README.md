# chartjs
A ChartJS interface for GNU Octave

Install the latest dev version from the Octave command prompt by typing 

 `pkg install "https://github.com/pr0m1th3as/octave-chartjs/archive/refs/heads/main.zip"`

This package also uses the [CrowCpp](https://crowcpp.org/master/) library (header only) for running a local web service for the generated charts. You need to install the standalone [Asio C++](https://think-async.com/Asio/) library for the package to compile correctly.
